# Hii, I'm Daniel!

I like writing software! Web development, CLI tooling, libraries, it's all fun!

If it is simple or intuitive to think of, it should be simple and intuitive to do. This precept guides most of my approach to development.

## Repos!
**[:cherry_blossom: blume](../../../blume)** has a handful of libraries I use in practically all of my other projects. It came to be after I made and tried to maintain 50 something CLI tools at once. I found dozens of common patterns, which blume provides abstractions over.

**[:card_index_dividers: list](../../../list)** is a replacement for a handful of core utils, from `ls`, `find`, to `head`, and `tail`. I have been using this as my "daily driver" for nearly a year now. `list` provides a naturl language like DSL query language. Great performance, beating both GNU, BusyBox, and various others (namely in massive directories).

**[:spider_web: wand](../../../wand)** is a dynamically configured reverse proxy with flexible access control and SNI. It is focused on ease of use, especially for hosting things for oneself, or for testing things such as webhooks during development.
