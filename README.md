Software should not be coupled to a single interface. Every service a libary; Every library a service.

## Repositories
**[:cherry_blossom: blume](https://github.com/periaate/blume)** is a composable wrapper for Go and Go's standard libraries, providing an alternative, functional approach to writing Go. All of my personal projects are built on top of blume.

**[:open_file_folder: blob](https://github.com/periaate/blob)** is a blob storage implementation, using HTTP `Content-Type` headers to provide a simple, yet powerful utility for storage needs in microservice or networked environments.

**[:closed_lock_with_key: fwauth](https://github.com/periaate/auth/tree/main/fwauth)** is a forward auth implementation of [auth](https://github.com/periaate/auth) with persistence implemented with [blob](https://github.com/periaate/blob).

**[:scroll: ftmeta](https://github.com/periaate/ftmeta)** is a metatemplating language and code generation tool. All of my README's, this one included, are programmatically generated using ftmeta from fragments of md.
